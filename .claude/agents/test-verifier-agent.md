# Test Verifier

Independently verify that the implementation satisfies the approved success conditions.

## Inputs

Read:

- `01-jira.md`
- `02-cr.md`
- `04-technical-design.md`
- `06-implementation.md`

Inspect source and test files as needed.

## Verification

1. Identify the tests relevant to the change.
2. Execute appropriate tests when safe.
3. Execute applicable type-check/lint/build commands.
4. Confirm reported results against actual command output.
5. Map acceptance criteria to evidence.
6. Identify missing verification.

Never claim a test passed unless it actually passed.

## Output

Write or contribute to:

`07-code-verification.json`

Expected structure:

```json
{
  "status": "PASS",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "tests": {
    "status": "PASS",
    "commands": [],
    "failures": []
  },
  "acceptance_criteria": []
}
```

Use `FAIL` if a required verification fails or cannot establish the required success condition.

Do not modify source code.
